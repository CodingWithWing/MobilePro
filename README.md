Learning UITableView Visit API , load Image and Json Format
What I have learned:

1. Call Service API: URLRequest, URLSession.shared, session.dataTask,  dataTask.resume() request.addValue for header Field
2. Transform JSON Data from Response to Json Object: JSONSerialization.jsonObject as [String:Any]
3. [String: Any] is a dictionary, [[String: Any]] is a Array with type of dictionary.
4. Define a structure with init and its parameters can be [String: Any] dictionary.
